VARIABLES
Player = the player who currently has the move
Opponent = Player's opponent
King = Player's king

METHODS
King_In_Check?
To determine if King is in check, first, the program must locate each of 
Opponent's pieces. For each of these, it must examine the piece's attacked 
adjacencies. If any of Opponent's pieces are attacking King, then King is in 
check. If the program has iterated over each of Opponent's pieces and none of 
them are attacking King, then King is not in check.

Stalemate?
To do this, first, it must locate each of Player's pieces on the 
board. Then, it must generate every possible move Player has and for each one
simulate a position where Player makes that move. For each of these simulated
positions, it must determine if King is in check using the logic described
above. If any of these simulated positions have do not have King in check, 
then there is no stalemate. Otherwise if the program iterates through each 
simulated position and each one has King in check, then there is a stalemate. 

TURN START, IS KING IN CHECK?:
Invoke King_In_Check?

  IF KING IS NOT IN CHECK, IS THERE A STALEMATE?:
  Invoke Stalemate?

    IF THERE IS A STALEMATE:
    If there is a stalemate, then the game is a draw.

    IF THERE IS NO STALEMATE:
    If there is no stalemate, then Player can choose to make any of their
    available legal moves before passing control to Opponent.
